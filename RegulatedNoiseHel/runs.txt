This is where I document what changes in what run. 


Reproducing

1. vs1: just taking the script and the object, no changes made: cluster numbering changed
2. vs2: run the same again to see if there are differences between runs: no. 
3. vs3: impose clusters of stephans object to get rid of differences visible in vs1: HVG/LVG overlap low
4. vs4: dont rerun SCT: slight changes

Seurat5

1. vs1: kept the FunctionLib and changed the SCT function from seurat to the separate small ones: no real overlap
2. vs2: imposed clusters form stephans object (started with testrun, new cells in there, probably corrupted) -> only 1 object run
3. vs3: not rerunning SCT: slight changes


Seurat5 integrated
1. vs1: discarded the FunctionLib of stephan, rewrote resvar table and bootstrapping function to match the seruat implemented SCT function (only this works for BL cells), no doublet detection




BPcells

1. vs1: Imposing of clusters, new version of how seurat5 stores SCT model, og bootstrapping function (?)
2. vs2: new bootstrapping function, same as in seurat5 integrated



Old + fast
1. vs1: old seurat + fast bootstrapping. some cells dont correlate at all in resvar
2. vs2: same but removed the LVG calc thing. now well reproduced



Pansci liver

1. vs1:  old seurat + fast boostrapping function. got rid of doublet detection. 
(still not final bc we have to debug the old + fast pipeline)
2. vs2: same as vs1 but got rid of the lvg tagging in the results. (old + fast + pansci) ran. 
3. vs3: same as vs2 but i added all age_sex groups and a loop to read the separate objects from the folder and process them separately. non WT mice are included, no save tsv. 
4. vs4: add tsc results save, only run WT mice
