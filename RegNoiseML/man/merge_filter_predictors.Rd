\usage{
merge_filter_predictors(
  pred_list,
  goi = NULL,
  sd_cutoff = 0.01,
  correlation_threshold = 0.9,
  convert_human = NULL,
  ortholog_file = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{pred_list}{Named list of tibbles (predictor tables)}

\item{goi}{Optional character vector of genes of interest}

\item{sd_cutoff}{Numeric, threshold for SD filtering}

\item{correlation_threshold}{Numeric, threshold for correlation filtering}

\item{convert_human}{Optional named logical vector (names have to match pred_list names) indicating which tables to convert from human to mouse gene symbols}

\item{ortholog_file}{Path to human-mouse ortholog TSV}

\item{n_cores}{Integer, cores for SD and correlation filtering}

\item{block_size}{Integer, block size for correlation computation}
}
\value{
List with merged predictors and optionally correlation-filtered predictors
}
\description{
Wrapper function that runs a full workflow:
1. Convert human genes to mouse (optional, as indicated by convert_human)
2. Filter by genes of interest
3. Filter by standard deviation
4. Merge predictors
5. Filter by correlation
