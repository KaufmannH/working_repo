\title{Convert human gene symbols to mouse orthologs}
\usage{
convert_human_mouse(df, ortholog_file)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A predictor data frame containing a column named \code{gene} with human gene symbols.}

\item{ortholog_file}{Character. Path to a TSV file with two columns: human and mouse gene symbols.
The file should have no header; column order is assumed to be \code{human}, \code{mouse}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with the same columns as the input, but with human genes replaced by
their corresponding mouse orthologs in the \code{gene} column. Rows without a valid
1:1 mouse ortholog are removed.
}
\description{
This function converts human gene symbols in a data frame to their corresponding
mouse orthologs using a provided ortholog mapping file. Only 1:1 ortholog pairs
(unique human–mouse mappings) are retained.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
mouse_df <- convert_human_mouse(human_df, "/path/to/orthologs_human_mouse.tsv")
